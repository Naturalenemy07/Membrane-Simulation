# Membrane-Simulation
Simulate membranes with beads. 

This program is a project in my Biomolecular Engineering class (CBE 579) at The University of Tennessee. I am quite new to C++ and am using this project to learn C++, simulation, and basic mathematical modeling.  As of Dec 11th 2019, the program simulates beads moving within periodic boundary conditions.  The box the beads are set in is currently a rectangular cuboid but the boundary conditions can be set in the input file.

Credit given to Dr. Dalheimer for the majority of the code-altered slightly to try and learn C++ and what happens when I change some code.
