# Membrane-Simulation
Simulate membranes with beads. 

This program is a project in my Biomolecular Engineering class (CBE 579) at The University of Tennessee. I am quite new to C++ and am using this project to learn C++, simulation, and basic mathematical modeling.  As of Nov 6th 2019, the program is a work in progress.
